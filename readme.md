# Republish by Asset plugin for Movable Type

This plugin for Movable Type makes it easy to republish Entries and Pages based
upon Asset use. Here's a scenario: you've updated the Asset -- perhaps with a
new Label or Description -- and now you need to republish the Entries that use
this Asset. Rather than going to each Entry or Page and republishing, this
plugin makes it one-click easy to republish everything.
